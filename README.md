===
x86-info-term is a curses-based viewer for x86 instruction info built with Python 3.

Right now this is just a terminal version of the [Intel Intrinsics Guide](https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/).

Basic vim keybindings are supported. See the source for more details--no documentation yet!
